Before we get started I want to say, yes there will still be *some* junior Devs that really know what they are doing will absolutely still have opportunities. Those that really wanted to *learn their tools* instead of just using them. The type of people who would use vim motions, try out Linux, or really go deep on customizing their IDE config.

## AI Autocomplete
AI Autocomplete is subtly shifting the mental work when creating from the developer to the LLM, what starts as simply filling out a switch case statement and boilerplate speeding up your work, ends with you pausing waiting for the AI to write your algorithms, usually correct but without you having understanding what you *didn't* write. 

## Agentic Dev
Why Create that feature when you can just let AI do it in the background? Its simple enough.

Agentic Modes are great in theory, you tell it what to do

## No/Low Code App Builders
Let the AI create the starting point, I was going to use NextJS, Tailwind for it anyway?
