I wanted an end to Bill Gates firm AD filled Grasp on my development experience, I also want to be able to as easily and quickly as possible setup a new OS with all my applications and configurations, How hard could it be... why not add a switch to Neovim while I'm at it.

## Arch BTW

now if you have existed as a developer for any amount of time you will have heard of 

- Arch, what is it, why
- why Nixos was interesting
- Getting Started with Arch (https://omarchy.org/)
- adding my customizations and applications
- Creating the ISO
- Profit???
